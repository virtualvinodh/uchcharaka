Uchcharaka is designed to transcribe non-Indian languages into Indian scripts while closely preserving their native pronunciations. It offers three levels of transcription, ranging from low to high fidelity. The high-fidelity level retains as many non-Indic phonemes as possible, while the low-fidelity level captures only the essential phonetic elements. Currently, the tool supports English (US and UK), Spanish (Spain and Latin America), Portuguese (Brazil and Portual), Italian, German, and French.
